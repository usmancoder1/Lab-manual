Exercise 2.1
Consider a scenario where a library wants to manage its collection of books. Each book has a 
unique ISBN, title, author, and publication year. The data is maintained in a doubly linked list. 
Create the following functions for the book collection:
1. Insert: Insert a new book record into the collection.
2. Search: Search for a book record using ISBN or title.
3. Modify: Update the details of an existing book record.
4. Display: Display all book records and the total number of books in the collection.

Exercise 2.2
Consider a scenario where a music app wants to manage its playlist of songs. Each song has a 
unique ID, title, artist name, and duration. The data is maintained in a doubly linked list, allowing 
for efficient traversal in both forward and backward directions. This is particularly useful for 
features like navigating through songs in a playlist and enabling users to easily move to the 
previous or next track. Create the following functions for the music playlist:
1. Insert: Add a new song record to the playlist.
2. Search: Find a song record using the title or artist name.
3. Modify: Update the details of an existing song record.
4. Display: Display all songs in the playlist, the total number of songs and total duration.
5. Play Next: Move to the next song in the playlist.
6. Play Previous: Move to the previous song in the playlist.
